        For now, Pet Gallery only contains images of my dogs and my tortoise.<br> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
      In the future, I may include images of cats I used to own (but couldn't keep due to getting dogs). <br> <br>

            The last link, "About Me" contains cool little facts about myself if you're interested.

            Although this isn't my pet and not technically part of the Pet Gallery, here's a cool extra link to footage of my friend's komodo dragon. He  underwent rigorous but necessary legal work to own one and is one of the few legitimate owners in the world!<br>
